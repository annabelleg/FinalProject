# FinalProject
Annabelle and Mariya's Term 2 Final Project!


####Brief Description: 
Useful program that provides you with gadgets that will aid in computation and graphing of 
various mathematical equations. 
User will have three options:
- a standard calculator, 
- a matrix modifier (to return various functions on user-inputted matrices), 
- and a visual graphing device.
The goal is to attempt to mimic the key functions of a graphing calculator
with the addition of new abilities such as computation of matrices
and tracing through graphs and their paths. 
Dealing with the various buttons can get tedious with the tiny buttons
and incomprehensible abbreviations. Our program will make math easier
and enable you to clearly perceive graphs of not only functions, 
but parametric and polar equations as well. It will also be easier to 
input more complex equations, such as piecewise functions or circles/ellipses. 
In addition, the matrix calculator will go much further with matrices than conventional calculators do,
with the ability to calculate things such as rank, determinant, reduced echelon form, inverse, etc,
as well as basic matrix multiplication/addition.

####Potential Challenges:
Making the graph mutable, such as zooming in and out. 
Interpreting user input of equations   

####Minimum features:
- Overall:
  - Easy user interface
  - Having multiple windows for options and settings.
- Graphing:
  - User input of equation
  - Way to evaluate equation
  -Data structure to store points that need to be graphed
  - Computer output of graph
- Matrices:
  - User input of matrix
  - Methods to modify matrix
  - Output of modified matrix
- Expressions:
  - User input of expression
  - Evaluation of expression and output

####Roadmap:
1. Basic program to modify/evaluate expressions, equations, and matrices.
2. Interfaces to display output
3. Ways to take user input
4. Perfection
